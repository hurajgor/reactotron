/**
 * Kill serve-sim processes left behind by a previous Reactotron run.
 *
 * serve-sim has no parent-death detection of its own: it handles SIGTERM and
 * friends, but nothing tells it to exit when Reactotron goes away without
 * sending a signal. A crash, a force quit, or `kill -9` therefore strands the
 * preview server, which launchd reparents to PID 1 and nothing ever reaps.
 * Stranded servers hold their ports and have been observed spinning at most of
 * a core each, so several of them accumulate into real CPU cost for the user.
 *
 * Reactotron cannot fix the child from the outside, so it sweeps on launch
 * instead. Only orphans are eligible: a process whose parent is still alive
 * belongs to another running Reactotron and is left untouched.
