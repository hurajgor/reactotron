title: MCP Server (Claude Code)
---

Reactotron includes a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets AI coding assistants like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) read your app's debug events, inspect a React Native runtime, and send commands from a coding conversation.

## Getting started

1. Open Reactotron and connect your app as usual.
2. Click the **MCP** button in the footer bar to start the server. The MCP server is **off by default** — you need to toggle it on before Claude Code can connect. A green dot indicates the server is running.
3. In your terminal, add the MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http reactotron http://localhost:4567/mcp
```

That's it. Claude Code can now read your app's timeline, inspect state, dispatch actions, and more. The development desktop app, **Reactotron Dev**, uses port `4568` by default, so use `http://localhost:4568/mcp` when that is the app you started.

## Enable the React Native agent runtime

The state and timeline tools work with a regular Reactotron connection. To let an MCP client inspect and operate React Native UI, add `agentRuntime()` to your development configuration:

```ts
import Reactotron, { agentRuntime } from "reactotron-react-native"

Reactotron.configure({ name: "My App" }).use(agentRuntime()).useReactNative().connect()
```

The runtime captures React elements by default. You can also register explicit nodes, action handlers, or a custom snapshot provider when your app needs behavior that cannot be inferred from its rendered tree.

## What can Claude Code do?

### Read debug data

Claude Code can read these resources on demand:

- **Timeline** — summarized debug events (type, timestamp, and a short preview) newest-first. Payloads are kept small so the response stays within token limits.
- **Timeline by Type** — full event data filtered by command type (e.g. `api.response`, `log`). Use this to drill into specific event types after reading the timeline summary.
- **App State** — the latest cached Redux/MST state snapshot
- **Network Log** — HTTP requests and responses with truncated body previews
- **Connected Apps** — which apps are connected, with their platform and version
- **Benchmarks** — performance benchmark results
- **State Subscriptions** — values at subscribed state paths whenever they change
- **AsyncStorage** — all AsyncStorage mutations (setItem, removeItem, etc.)

### Send commands

Claude Code can also interact with your running app:

- **Dispatch Redux actions** — e.g. "dispatch a RESET action"
- **Explore state keys** — list keys at any state path without fetching values (lightweight way to navigate the state tree)
- **Request a fresh state snapshot** — asks the app for current state at a specific path
- **Replace app state** — hot-swap the entire state tree
- **Send custom commands** — trigger any custom command registered in your app
- **Show image overlay** — overlay a design mockup on the running app (supports local files)
- **Subscribe to state paths** — watch specific parts of state for changes
- **Clear the event buffer** — reset what Claude sees to focus on new interactions

### Inspect and operate React Native UI

When `agentRuntime()` is enabled, MCP clients can work with semantic UI instead of screen coordinates:

- **`agent_ui_snapshot`** — request the current runtime tree.
- **`agent_ui_find`** — search that tree by `testID`, runtime `id` or type, text, accessibility label, role, hint, placeholder, enabled state, or visibility.
- **`agent_ui_press`**, **`agent_ui_fill`**, and **`agent_ui_scroll`** — shortcuts for common actions. Scroll supports `ScrollView`, `FlatList`, and `SectionList` arguments.
- **`agent_ui_action`** — run a registered or inferred action when the shortcut tools do not fit.

Start with a snapshot or find request, prefer an exact `testID`, then use an accessibility selector when one is not available. Text, label, hint, and placeholder matching is case-insensitive substring matching. If more than one node matches, use the returned `id`, add selector fields, or pass `index` to choose one match. Actions return a fresh snapshot by default; the press, fill, and scroll shortcuts omit it by default for speed.

## Control an embedded iOS Simulator

On macOS, the desktop MCP host can control the iOS Simulators that Reactotron embeds. This requires Xcode Command Line Tools and an installed iOS Simulator runtime. These are local desktop operations, not React Native runtime actions.

1. Use `list_ios_simulators` to find an available device and its UDID.
2. Use `open_ios_simulator` to boot it and begin its Reactotron stream. Use `list_ios_simulator_creation_options` followed by `create_ios_simulator` only when you need a new persistent simulator.
3. Use `agent_ui_snapshot`, `agent_ui_find`, and the action tools above to operate the app inside the device. Use `control_ios_simulator` only for device-level Home and orientation controls.
4. Use `ios_simulator_screenshot` for visual verification, `reload_ios_app` to request a Metro reload, or `toggle_ios_simulator_appearance` to switch light and dark appearance.

`create_ios_simulator` and `shutdown_ios_simulator` require `confirm: true`: creating a simulator persists it on the machine, while shutdown stops its stream and powers it off. `reconnect_ios_simulator` restarts a disconnected preview stream.

### Multi-app support

If multiple apps are connected to Reactotron, Claude Code will ask which app you're working on. It can auto-detect the right app when only one is connected.

## Redaction

Reactotron applies a default-on redaction pass to every MCP response, replacing well-known sensitive field names and token formats with `[REDACTED]` before they leave the server. A shield icon next to the MCP button reflects the live state: **green** while redaction is fully enforced, **amber** when at least one connected client has opted out via a permission you've granted. Redaction is defence in depth — see the [Limitations and gotchas](#limitations-and-gotchas) section for the audit you should do before connecting an LLM.

### What gets redacted

Out of the box, the following are replaced with `[REDACTED]`:

- **Sensitive keys** (matched at any nesting level, case-insensitive) — credentials like `password`/`passwd`/`pwd`, `secret`, `client_secret`, `private_key`, `credentials`, `ssn`, `creditcard`; API keys like `api_key`/`apikey`/`x-api-key`; auth tokens like `token`, `bearer`, `jwt`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`; session/CSRF like `session`/`sessionid`, `csrf`/`xsrf`; HTTP header names like `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `X-Auth-Token`, `X-CSRF-Token`, `X-XSRF-Token`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`; and common variants
- **String values** matching common token formats — Bearer tokens, JWTs (`eyJ...`), OpenAI keys (`sk-...`), Anthropic keys (`sk-ant-...`), GitHub PATs/OAuth/user-to-server tokens (`ghp_/ghs_/gho_/ghu_/ghr_...`), Slack tokens (`xoxb-...`), AWS access key IDs (`AKIA...`), Google API keys (`AIza...`), Stripe keys (`sk_live_/pk_test_/...`), and PEM-encoded private key blocks
- **URL query parameters** whose names match any sensitive key (e.g. `?api_key=abc` becomes `?api_key=[REDACTED]`)
- **Form-urlencoded bodies** — strings shaped like `k=v&k=v` (e.g. `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request bodies) get the same per-field redaction as URL query parameters

### Configuring redaction in Reactotron

Click the gear icon next to the MCP button to open the redaction settings modal. From there you can:

- Add or remove **sensitive keys** (covers both payload field names and HTTP header names), **state path patterns**, and **value patterns** (regex)
- Toggle whether connected apps are allowed to **disable redaction entirely** (off by default)
- Toggle whether connected apps are allowed to **remove default rules** (off by default)

State path patterns use dot-separated paths and support a trailing wildcard. For example, `auth.tokens.*` redacts every key under `auth.tokens` in your app state.

Changes take effect on the next MCP request — no restart needed.

### Client-side configuration

Apps can send redaction preferences during the Reactotron connection handshake via the `mcpRedaction` option:

```js
Reactotron.configure({
  // ... other options
  mcpRedaction: {
    // Merge additional rules on top of server defaults (always allowed)
    additionalRules: {
      sensitiveKeys: ["myInternalField", "x-internal-auth"],
    },
    // Request removal of specific default rules (requires server permission)
    removeRules: {
      sensitiveKeys: ["cookie"],
    },
    // Request disabling redaction entirely (requires server permission)
    disableRedaction: true,
  },
})
```

This uses a **two-key model**: the server always applies its default rules unless *both* the client requests a relaxation *and* the server has enabled the corresponding permission in the settings modal. This prevents a misconfigured app from accidentally exposing secrets.

### Multi-app redaction

When multiple apps are connected, **each app's data is redacted with that app's own configuration**, even within a single MCP response that aggregates events from several apps (timeline, network, asyncstorage, etc.). One app's `additionalRules` won't redact another app's data, and one app's `removeRules` won't weaken redaction for any other app's data.

### Limitations and gotchas

> **Audit your app's payloads before pointing an LLM at the MCP server.** Redaction is defence in depth, not a guarantee. The default rules catch widely-used names and token formats, but anything app-specific (custom field names, homegrown token shapes, bare values without a recognisable shape) passes through unredacted. Do the audit *before* connecting any LLM — once an LLM has seen a secret, you can't unsend it. Two practical ways to audit: search your codebase for the field names you store credentials, tokens, or PII under, and inspect a normal Reactotron desktop session (the desktop UI is unredacted, so what you see there is roughly what an LLM would see minus the default-rule matches). Add anything sensitive to `additionalRules` (or to the desktop's settings modal) before the first LLM connection.

A few specific things worth knowing:

- **The Reactotron desktop UI is not redacted.** Redaction only happens at the MCP boundary. The desktop UI shows captured data verbatim — that's by design, since you're debugging your own app.
- **Redaction is a blocklist, not an allowlist.** Field names that aren't in `sensitiveKeys` and string values that don't match any `valuePatterns` regex pass through verbatim. A field literally called `mySpecialSecret` or a homegrown token format like `xz-…-…` is invisible to the default rules. Add them via the settings modal or `additionalRules`.
- **AsyncStorage values rely on the storage key carrying the sensitive name.** `AsyncStorage.setItem("auth:password", "hunter2")` redacts because the storage key contains `password`. `AsyncStorage.setItem("appData", "hunter2")` does *not* — neither the key nor the bare value match any default rule, so the value passes through verbatim. If your app stores secrets under non-descriptive storage keys, redaction won't help. Use the `ignore` option on the AsyncStorage plugin to skip those keys entirely.
- **State path patterns only fire at known anchors.** The `reactotron://state/current` resource and the `request_state` tool both pass the originating state path so absolute patterns (e.g. `auth.tokens.*`) match correctly. Other resources don't carry that anchor and can't apply path-based rules. If a sensitive subtree never matches by key name or value pattern, path patterns alone may not catch it.
- **State path patterns support trailing wildcard only.** `auth.tokens.*` works. `users.*.password` does not — you'd need to add `password` to `sensitiveKeys` (it already is by default) or list each path explicitly.
- **Custom commands and `display` payloads are walked generically.** If you emit free-form data via `Reactotron.display(...)` or a custom command, only key-name and value-pattern rules apply. Sensitive content in arbitrary shapes is on you.
- **Server defaults apply at the boundary, not at storage.** The relay server still receives the full payload over the WebSocket and stores it in the in-memory event buffer. Anyone with desktop access (or who can attach a debugger to the Reactotron process) can see the unredacted data. Redaction stops the data from reaching the MCP client; it does not encrypt anything at rest.

## Configuration

The release desktop app defaults to MCP port **4567**; **Reactotron Dev** defaults to **4568** so it can run beside a release installation. The footer displays the active port whenever MCP is running. There is no in-app port editor: the release-app value is stored as `mcpPort` in Reactotron's electron-store config — at `~/Library/Application Support/Reactotron/config.json` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Reactotron\config.json` on Windows, or `~/.config/Reactotron/config.json` on Linux. Edit the JSON and restart Reactotron to pick up a release-app port change.

For a development run, set `REACTOTRON_MCP_PORT` before starting the app. The development identity keeps its own application data and pins its defaults to the development ports.

The server only binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and is not accessible from other machines on your network.

The MCP buffer holds the most recent **500 commands** from the relay. Once that fills, the oldest events drop off — the timeline / network / state resources only reflect what's still in the buffer. Use the `clear_timeline` tool to reset it before reproducing a specific issue.

## Image overlay

The `show_overlay` tool lets Claude Code overlay an image on your running app — useful for comparing a design mockup against the actual UI.

```text
"Show the design mockup from ~/Downloads/design.png as an overlay on the app"
```

- Accepts local file paths, `file://` URIs, `http://` URLs, or `data:` URIs
- Local files are automatically converted to base64
- Image dimensions are extracted from PNG/JPEG/GIF headers
- Supported formats: **PNG, JPEG, GIF**

## Example conversation

> **You:** "Look at the Reactotron timeline and tell me what's happening"
>
> **Claude:** _reads the timeline summary_ "I can see 3 API calls failing with 401 errors and some state changes. Let me get the full details on those failed requests."
>
> **Claude:** _reads timeline/api.response_ "All three requests to `/api/users`, `/api/orders`, and `/api/profile` are returning 401 Unauthorized. Your auth token might be expired. Want me to check the current state?"
>
> **You:** "Yes, check the auth state"
>
> **Claude:** _calls request_state_keys, then request_state with path='auth'_ "The auth token in state is empty. It looks like the login flow isn't saving the token. Let me look at the Redux actions..."

## Architecture

The MCP server runs inside the Reactotron desktop app as a separate package (`reactotron-mcp`). It reads directly from the relay server's connections and event stream — no proxy, no separate process, and no changes to your React Native app.
